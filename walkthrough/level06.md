# Level 5 -> 6

- Level Page: https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit6.html
- Goal: Get the password in a file somewhere under the inhere directory, that is human-readable, 1033 bytes in size, and not executable.
- What you'll learn: the flags -size and -executable in the find command, and also how to implement a logical NOT in commands.
---
In the previous level [Level 4 -> 5](/walkthrough/level05.md), we've discussed how to scan for human-readable files in a directory like this:
```
bandit5@bandit:~$ find . -print0 | xargs -0 file | grep text
./.profile:                        ASCII text
./.bashrc:                         ASCII text
./inhere/maybehere14/-file2:       ASCII text, with very long lines (8350)
./inhere/maybehere14/-file1:       ASCII text, with very long lines (4281)
...
./inhere/maybehere08/.file2:       ASCII text, with very long lines (746)
./inhere/maybehere08/.file1:       ASCII text, with very long lines (8168)
./inhere/maybehere08/spaces file1: ASCII text
./.bash_logout:                    ASCII text
```

Note: Weâ€™re still using `-print0` and `-0` so that filenames with spaces or special characters are handled safely.

There are a lot of ASCII text files in this level. How do we identify which file is 1033 bytes in size and not executable? We use the `-size` and `-executable` flags in the find command.

```
find . -size 1033c -print0 | xargs -0 file | grep text
```

`-size 1033c` means exactly 1033 bytes, the `c` tells `find` to count in bytes instead of 512-byte blocks.

```
find . ! -executable -print0 | xargs -0 file | grep text
```

`-executable` tells the find command to look for executable files. Meanwhile, `! -executable` tells find to look for files that aren't executable. In find, `!` (or `-not`) negates the condition that follows; here it inverts `-executable` so we only match non-executable files.

Altogether, the command looks like this:

```
bandit5@bandit:~$ find . -size 1033c ! -executable -print0 | xargs -0 file | grep text
./inhere/maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines (1000)
```

We've got our file, all we have to do now is read it.

```
bandit5@bandit:~$ cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2
