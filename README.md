# OverTheWire Bandit Walkthrough
The OverTheWire Bandit Wargame is a game that practically teaches users foundational Linux command line skills, cybersecurity concepts, and basic hacking techniques.
This is a walkthrough of the bandit wargame by OverTheWire.

To participate in this game, you can use any Operating System (OS) capable of using Secure Shell (SSH). In laymen's terms, SSH is a tool used to connect to other systems. More specifically, it is a network protocol that establishes encrypted connections between computers for secure remote access.
SSH will allow users to connect to the game server, which is a Linux environement, meaning users can use Linux commands without having a Linux system.

I highly recommend for players to try and solve each level themselves before looking at the solution by searching the internet for definitions, tools, techniques, and getting a rough understanding of what the problem demands.
